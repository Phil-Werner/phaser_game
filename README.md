# Knights Vs. Barbarians

This is game I'm working on using PHASER.  It will be a turn based strategy game utilizing a hex grid.  You can try out what I have so far at: https://phil-werner.github.io/
(Give it a minute to load.)

To move, click on the knight in the bottom left corner.  Stars will appear on tiles within range.  If you end your turn next to a barbarian you can click on it to attack it.  Three hits kills an enemy.  They will move towards you and attack you, but the hero is currently invincible.
